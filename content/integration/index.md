## Cenit Integration Guide

The Cenit hub connects your storefront to third-party applications and services, and provides a reliable and managed platform for you to build your own custom integrations.

Leveraging the power of our hub is simple as it uses basic HTTP calls to relay messages to your system as they occur within a Cenit storefront. This form of integration is often referred to as Web Hooks or HTTP Callbacks.

This guide will give you a high level introduction to the Cenit hub, and provide details on all the features currently available.
