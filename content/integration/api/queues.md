`spree:order:poll`, etc.

* state - The current state of the message. This can be completed, pending, 
failing, scheduled, never_processed, or parked.

* start_date - Filter messages created after a date. For example, 2013-11-10T17:17:34+00:00

* end_date - Filter messages created before a date. For example, 2013-11-10T17:17:34+00:00

* message_id - The id of the message

* mapping_id - The id of the mapping
