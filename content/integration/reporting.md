## Overview

The Spree Commerce hub connector is designed to make managing your storefront integrations quick and painless. It is what handles communication between your storefront and the Spree Commerce hub itself.

In addition to allowing you to [configure](configuration) your integrations, it also provides functionality that let's you inspect your message queues and view any generated [notifications](notification_messages) from the hub.

***
This guide assumes you already have the Spree Commerce hub connector configured for your Spree storefront. For more information on configuring the hub, please view the [Configuration](configuration) guide.

## Message Queues

This section explains how to view messages in the incoming, accepted and archived queues. For more information on messages in general, please view the [messages](overview#messages) section of the [Overview](overview) guide.

### Viewing Message Queues

![Integration Overview](/images/integration/integration_overview.jpg)

When on the  integration overview screen of the "Integration" tab of your storefront's backend, you will see three options that allow you to view the different message queues.

#### Incoming Queue

The incoming queue contains newly created messages that have not yet been processed by the Spree Commerce hub. This is the starting queue for all new messages.

#### Accepted Queue

The accepted queue is split into four sections:

* **Pending** - Messages that are pending are waiting to be processed by the hub.
* **Failing** - Messages that are failing were not able to be processed by the hub successfully, but will be retried again at a future time. If you see a message here, it means there is a problem with it.
* **Scheduled** - Messages that are scheduled to be processed at a future time.
* **Parked** - Messages that are parked have failed but have retries disabled.

In general you won't see messages in the accepted queue unless they have failed or are scheduled to be processed at a future time.

#### Archived Queue

The archived queue contains messages that have been successfully processed by the hub.

Once selecting a queue to view, you will see a listing of all the messages in that queue:

You can filter the messages listing using the dropdowns and inputs above the listing. The following filter options are available:

* **State** (accepted queue only) - Filter messages by their current state in the accepted queue (pending, failing, scheduled, or parked)
* **Messages** - Filter certain types of messages (order:new, shipment:ready, etc.)
* **Consumer** - Filter messages by their consumer
* **Date range** - Filter messages by their date (clicking on this input shows options for selecting a date range)

To inspect a message in more detail, click on the "eye" icon to the right of a message.

### Inspecting Messages

![Inspecting A Message](/images/integration/inspect_message.jpg)

Once selecting a message to view, you will be taken to a view similar to the one shown above. This view allows you to inspect the following attributes by clicking on the links on the right side of the screen:

* **Children** - A list of messages the current message is a parent of.
* **Notifications** - Any notifications associated with this message.
* **Last Error** - The last error message associated with this message, if one exists.
* **Result** - The response from the endpoint.
* **Attributes** - All attributes of the current message.
* **Payload** - The payload contains all message-specific details. For example, in the case of `order:new` it would contains order details.

If you are viewing a message in the accepted queue that has errors present, you can retry the message by clicking on the "Retry" ![Retry Icon](/images/integration/message_icon_retry.png) icon. You can also archive accepted messages by clicking on the "Archive" ![Archive Icon](/images/integration/message_icon_archive.png) icon.

## Notifications

This section explains how to view notifications generated by the hub after processing endpoint service responses. For more information on notification messages in general, please view the [notifications](notification_messages) guide.

### Viewing Notifications

To get to the notifications view, click on the "Notifications" link at the top of the "Integration" tab of your storefront's backend. Like the message queues, you can filter notifications by the following attributes:

* **Level** - Filter notifications by the severity of the warning (info, warn, or error)
* **Reference Type** - Filter notifications by the type of object that generated the notification. For example, an `order:new` message might generate a notification with a reference type of order.
* **Reference Token** - Filter notifications by their reference token. The reference token is generally a way to reference the object generating the notification. For example, a notification with a reference type of order would have it's reference token set to the order number.

![Notifications Listing](/images/integration/notifications_listing.jpg)

You can inspect a notification by clicking on the "eye" icon to the right of the notification. This will expand the notification and show an inline view of all the notification's attributes.
